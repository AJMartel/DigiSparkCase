  A box that can hold a single DigiStump DigiSpark arduino module.
  It is a clamshell box, with a slot in the bottom for in/out wires
  and a relief in the top for the LED.

  This directory contains both the scad source to generate the case,
  and a gcode file optimized for printing on a Monoprice Select Mini.
  (The latter was generated by Cura V15.04.4.)
